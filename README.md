# Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models

This repository contains my coursework and implementations from the **"Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models"** course by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## About the Course

This course is part of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/deep-learning-specialization/) and focuses on sequence models used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It covers:

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Sequence-to-sequence models
- Attention mechanism
- Transformer architecture

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

```
Natural-Langauge-Processing-With-Sequence-Model--Coursera--DeepLearning.ai/
|
├── Week_1/         # Recurrent Neural Networks
├── Week_2/         # Word Embeddings
├── Week_3/         # Sequence-to-sequence Models and Attention
├── Week_4/         # Transformers
├── datasets/       # Datasets used in assignments and projects
├── notebooks/      # Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations
└── README.md       # This file
```

### Key Contents

1. **Week 1**: Introduction to RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs.
2. **Week 2**: Building and using word embeddings.
3. **Week 3**: Implementing sequence-to-sequence models with attention.
4. **Week 4**: Understanding and implementing Transformers.
